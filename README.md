# A whole-genome assembly of St. Augustinegrass and visualizing diversity within the species

This repository supports the development of the first published genome sequence of the popular turfgrass, St. Augustinegrass. This reference genome provides a high-quality closely related genome for future genomic work with warm-season turfgrasses and will allow for the expansion of the molecular toolkits that are available to turfgrass breeders to allow building tools to enable more efficient selection.

## Description

We present a reference-grade chromosome-scale genome assembly for the popular freeze-tolerant diploid cultivar ‘Raleigh’, utilizing data from PacBio CCS, Illumina, and Hi-C technologies. The reference genome has been resolved into two haplotype assemblies (465.41 and 401.52 Mb), accounting for 95.2% and 82.1% of the expected haplotype genome size respectively, each anchored on the nine chromosomes and a total of 62,454 genes. Analysis of the assembly revealed 50.70% of the genome contained repeats. Analysis of the diversity within the species not covered by the reference genome was obtained by a panel of 79 genotypes including commercial cultivars, breeding lines, and plant introductions by low-coverage sequencing identifying 605,038 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
